---

### google-flights

**Purpose:** Search Google Flights for airfare pricing estimates using Playwright browser automation.

**Best for:**
- Estimating airfare costs for trip budgeting
- Comparing prices across different dates
- Finding routing options for complex itineraries
- Quick price comparisons with visual results

**How it works:**
1. Constructs Google Flights URLs with encoded search parameters (faster than UI navigation)
2. Uses headless Playwright to navigate and extract results
3. Supports multi-city, round-trip, and one-way searches
4. All cabin classes: Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First

**Example use:**
```
Search business class flights from Seattle to Hong Kong for December 2026
```

**Requirements:**
- Playwright MCP server (headless)
  ```bash
  claude mcp add --scope user playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest --headless --browser msedge
  ```

---

### ita-matrix

**Purpose:** Search ITA Matrix for detailed fare information, routing rules, and pricing breakdowns.

**Best for:**
- Fare class and booking code research
- Understanding complex routing rules
- Detailed price breakdowns with taxes/fees
- Multi-city itineraries with specific constraints
- Finding the cheapest fare basis codes

**How it works:**
1. Builds JSON search payload and encodes it for URL
2. Uses **headed** Playwright (ITA blocks headless browsers)
3. Requires manual trigger workaround (click "Modify search" then "Search")
4. Searches take 2-5 minutes (this is normal)
5. Extracts detailed fare information from results

**Example use:**
```
Search ITA Matrix for Seattle to Tokyo round-trip in business class, November 2026
```

**Requirements:**
- Playwright MCP server (headed - required, ITA blocks headless)
  ```bash
  claude mcp add --scope user plugin_playwright_playwright -- npx -y @anthropic/claude-code-mcp-plugin-playwright@latest
  ```

**Note:** ITA Matrix is research-only and doesn't book flights. Use the fare information to book directly with airlines or OTAs.

**Best for:**

**How it works:**
1. Runs a Python script that queries Flighty's local SQLite database

|---------|-------------|
| `list [limit]` | List upcoming flights |
| `next` | Get next upcoming flight |
| `date YYYY-MM-DD` | Flights on a specific date |

| `stats` | Flight statistics |

**Available commands:**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `list [limit]` | List upcoming trips |
| `trip "Name"` | Get full trip details (flights, hotels, activities) |
| `flights [limit]` | Upcoming flights across all trips |
