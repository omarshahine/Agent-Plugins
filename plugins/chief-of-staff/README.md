# Chief-of-Staff

The "one plugin to rule them all" for personal productivity. Chief-of-Staff is an uber-orchestrator that consolidates email triage, package tracking, reminder creation, and newsletter management into a single unified system.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install chief-of-staff@my-plugins
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Configure your email provider and persona
/chief-of-staff:setup

# 2. Summon your assistant by name!
/friday              # or whatever name you chose

# 3. Or use specific commands
/chief-of-staff:triage
```

## Persona System

Give your Chief-of-Staff a custom identity with a **persona**. During setup, you'll configure:

- **Name**: Your assistant's name (e.g., "Friday", "Max", "Jarvis")
- **Your Name**: For personalized greetings (optional)
- **Greeting Style**: Professional, friendly, or casual

### Dynamic Summon Command

Once configured, a personalized command is created automatically:

```bash
/friday           # Quick assessment + suggestions
/friday triage    # Jump to inbox triage
/friday parcel    # Process packages
/friday status    # Full dashboard
```

### Email Signatures

When your assistant drafts replies, they're signed with:

```
Friday (Jane's AI assistant)
```

This clearly identifies AI-generated replies while maintaining professionalism.

## Architecture

Chief-of-Staff contains 12 specialized sub-agents:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `inbox-interviewer` | Interactive questions-first inbox triage |
| `inbox-to-parcel` | Package tracking from shipping emails |
| `inbox-to-reminder` | Create reminders from action items |
| `newsletter-unsubscriber` | Unsubscribe from unwanted newsletters |
| `digest-generator` | Summarize automated emails |
| `organization-analyzer` | Analyze Trash/Archive patterns |
| `pattern-learner` | Bootstrap filing rules from folders |
| `inbox-triage` | Apply learned rules to inbox |
| `folder-optimizer` | Suggest folder reorganization |
| `decision-learner` | Learn from triage decisions |
| `batch-html-generator` | Visual batch triage interface |
| `batch-processor` | Execute batch triage decisions |

## Core Workflow

The core workflow is **questions-first**:

```
COLLECT -> EXECUTE -> LEARN
```

1. **COLLECT**: Ask questions for each email, store decisions (no API calls yet)
2. **EXECUTE**: Run all actions in bulk (efficient API usage)
3. **LEARN**: Record decisions, update confidence scores, detect patterns

## Data Files

All data is stored in `data/` (gitignored, with `.example.yaml` templates):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `settings.yaml` | Persona config, provider settings (email, parcel, reminders) |
| `user-preferences.yaml` | Sender overrides, never-file lists |
| `filing-rules.yaml` | Learned filing patterns with confidence |
| `delete-patterns.yaml` | Patterns for delete suggestions |
| `decision-history.yaml` | Learning data from triage sessions |
| `interview-state.yaml` | Resume state for triage sessions |
| `batch-state.yaml` | HTML batch triage session state |
| `newsletter-lists.yaml` | Allowlist and unsubscribed senders |

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- Email MCP server (Fastmail active; Gmail/Outlook planned)

**Optional (enhance functionality):**
- Parcel API MCP - Package tracking
- Apple PIM MCP v2.4.0+ - Reminders and calendar with profile support (`/plugin install apple-pim@my-plugins`)
- Playwright plugin - Newsletter unsubscribe web forms

## Apple PIM Profile Integration

Apple PIM v2.4.0+ supports **profiles** for filtered access to calendars, reminders, and contacts. Profiles let you restrict which PIM data is visible to Chief-of-Staff (e.g., only personal calendars, not work ones).

### How Profiles Work

Profiles are **transparent at the MCP tool layer**. The MCP server passes `APPLE_PIM_PROFILE` as an environment variable to the Swift CLIs. COS agents calling `mcp__apple-pim__*` tools don't need any code changes -- profiles are configured entirely via environment.

### Setup

1. **Create a profile** using the Apple PIM plugin:
   ```bash
   /apple-pim:configure
   ```
   Or manually create a JSON file at `~/.config/apple-pim/profiles/{name}.json`

2. **Activate the profile** in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "APPLE_PIM_PROFILE": "personal"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run setup** to save the profile in COS settings:
   ```bash
   /chief-of-staff:setup
   ```
   Setup will auto-detect available profiles and let you select one.

### No Profile (Default)

If no profile is configured (`APPLE_PIM_PROFILE` is unset), Apple PIM uses the base config at `~/.config/apple-pim/config.json`, which provides access to all calendars, reminders, and contacts.

## Migration from Old Plugins

If migrating from standalone inbox-triage, inbox-to-parcel, etc., run:

```bash
./scripts/migrate-data.sh
```

See the main README for detailed migration instructions.

## Private Extensions

Power users can extend Chief-of-Staff with private capabilities by creating a separate private plugin that:

1. Adds custom agents for proprietary workflows
2. Includes a skill that teaches COS about the private agents
3. Private agents can call COS sub-agents via Task tool

Example skill in a private plugin:

```markdown
# skills/private-capabilities/SKILL.md
---
description: |
  Private agents available to Chief-of-Staff:
  - filing-cabinet-organizer: Manage Filing Cabinet documents
  - inbox-action-vendor: Download vendor invoices
