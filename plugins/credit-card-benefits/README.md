```

/credit-card-benefits:info amex
/credit-card-benefits:info chase
```

## Agent

The `benefits-tracker` agent can be invoked naturally:

- "What Amex credits do I still need to use?"
- "Show me my unused Chase Sapphire benefits"
- "What benefits are expiring this month?"
- "I just used my Lululemon credit"
- "Import my latest Amex statement"

## Data Storage

```
~/.config/credit-card-benefits/
├── checklist.yaml      # Main tracking data (YAML for easy editing)
└── ynab-token          # YNAB API token (if using YNAB API)
```

## How Anniversary Detection Works

The plugin uses **annual fee posting date** as the most reliable anniversary indicator:

1. During initial sync, it looks back 12 months for annual fee transactions
2. Patterns detected: "ANNUAL FEE", "ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE", etc.
3. The posting date becomes your `lastAnnualFeeDate`
4. `nextAnnualFeeDate` is calculated automatically

This is more reliable than card open date because:
- Anniversary benefits reset when the fee posts, not when you applied
- Fee posting dates can shift slightly year to year
- The plugin tracks `annualFeeHistory` for reference
